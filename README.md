| [Hough lines](hough)                         | Hough transform is a feature extraction technique used in image processing. The technique is used to detect lines in images. |
| [Connected components](connected_components) | Identifies 8-way connectivity in 2D boolean images using tensorflow addons' connected components operation, which identifies 4-way connectivity (neighbors above, below, left, and right) |
